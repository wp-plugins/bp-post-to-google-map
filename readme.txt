BP Post to Google Map lets you add lat/lng coordinates to Posts and display a Google Map on your site.  

== Description ==

BP Post to Google Map adds a box to the Post edit screen to collect latitude and longitude.  Posts with lat/lng can be displayed on a responsive Google Map anywhere on your site using a shortcode.

*The Google Map is responsive and will change to fit inside the container around it.

*Decide what to display in the Infowindow (the popup appearing after click on a map marker).
*If using the featured image, whether the image will float right.  Default is centered at top.
*Set the coordinates that the map will be centered on.  
*Set the default zoom level for the map (0 = Whole Earth, 19 = Building Level)

The map will expand to the width of the container it is in, usually the Page or Post article container.  For maximum width, use a full-width template.
